text = "About James Web telescope:
For this great telescope, we need to build it from materials that collect
very weak light (approximately, every second, one photon will reach the 
earth). This mirror is needed to be covered with gold and 3 meters in 
radius, because gold reflects more infrared than silver. This mirror is so 
heavy and huge to be in a space rocket, so NASA decided to make it as 
puzzle pieces not as a complete mirror. Determinately, they made 18 
hexagonal rings made of beryllium, because it has low mass and 
withstand very low temperatures. Using quantum coating technology, a 
very thin layer of gold (does not exceed 100 nanometers) was made on 
the beryllium rings. Although the mirror of the James Webb telescope is 
2.5 bigger than the Hubble telescope, it weighted 2.5 lighter, which is a 
great innovation for the humanity. All of these materials were used to 
make the main mirror only, which have to collect as photons as possible 
and reflect them to the second mirror located 7 meters away from it. 
For the second mirror, a tripod was made with a joint that can be folded 
so that the mirror can be attached to the main one. The second mirror 
was equipped with motors that adjust its position. The focal lens of 
the second mirror has four different sensors that captured infrared 
light. Those sensors are: NIRcam, NIRISS, FGS, and MIRI. To give the 
telescope its withstand against temperatures, it was equipped with a 
shield that blocks sunlight. This shield was made from a material known 
as Kapton, because it does not expand nor corrode. This shield was 
covered with a thin layer of aluminum to reflect the sun light. Thanks 
to NASA to avoid around 200 possible problems in building this shield.
This shield is designed to reduce the temperatures from 110 degree to 
around -223 celsious degree. The entire telescope have been tested in 
NASA specialized rooms and could withstand with all possible 
conditions in the space.
