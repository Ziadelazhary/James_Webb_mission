text = "What is a telescope?
A telescope is used by astronomers to view objects in the distance. 
The bulk of telescopes, including all large telescopes, employ curved 
mirrors to gather and focus light from the night sky. The light from faroff objects was captured by 
two lenses in early telescopes. One is 
used to capture as much light as possible from the objects, while the 
other is used to capture the light that is reflected back into one image. 
The clarity and resolution of the image captured improve with bigger 
lenses. These telescopes needed to be modified since they had a few 
problems that made it difficult to capture distant objects. For instance, 
the lenses were overly heavy, and the effort was both expensive and 
difficult. Additionally, a portion of the light that entered those lenses 
and was divided into the seven hues of the spectrum was reflected by 
the glass, impairing the clarity of the image.
To solve this problem, a new kind of telescopes has been invented 
(AKA) reflected telescope, which uses mirrors instead of lenses. The 
main mirror collects the light from distant objects, and reflects this on 
the other mirror that reflects this light and creates the image. The 
grand telescope (AKA) CANARIAS (located in Spain) has a mirror with a 
diameter of 10 m is the greatest reflected telescope known in our 
Earth."
